Valid State

A Meeting has fields
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        uint256 numOfParticipents;
        address organizer;
        MeetingStatus status;
		
where MeetingStatus is enum 
       {UNINITIALIZED,
        PENDING,
        STARTED,
        ENDED,
        CANCELLED}

1. There are no restrictions in the specifications on UNINITIALIZED meetings.

2. If a meeting is PENDING then:
startTime <= endTime and both are non-zero
numOfParticipents=0
organizer != 0x0

3. If a meeting is STARTED then:
startTime <= endTime and both are non-zero
numOfParticipents>=0
organizer != 0x0

4. If a meeting is CANCELLED then:
startTime <= endTime and both are non-zero
numOfParticipents>=0
organizer != 0x0

4. If a meeting is ENDED then:
startTime <= endTime and both are non-zero
numOfParticipents>=0
organizer != 0x0

State Transition

1. To make a PENDING meeting, the time stamp (start/end) must be set in the future, and the number
of participants must be zero, and the organizer must be the message sender.
2. Anybody can change a meeting from PENDING to STARTED.
3. The owner (and only the owner) of a PENDING meeting can change its status to CANCELLED.
4. The only valid way to reach the ENDED state, is if the meeting is both STARTED
and the current time >= end_time. If these two conditions are met, any participant can end the meeting.
5.  A meeting that has already occurred can not be labeled CANCELLED.	
6. Modularity:
	A. The only way to end a meeting is endMeeting
	B. The only way to cancel a meeting is cancelMeeting
	C. The only way to start a meeting is startMeeting
	D. The only way to schedule a meeting is scheduleMeeting
	
Variable Transition

1. The total number of meetings (including ENDED, CANCELLED) always increases (i.e., history
is never deleted).
2. The only way to increase the number of participants is joinMeeting.
3. Integrity of Time-Stamp 

High-Level Property

1. Meetings can not be rescheduled or their properties (owner, start/end time) tampered with.
2. Every function call affects only one meeting 

Unit Tests

1. joinMeeting correctly increases the number of participants.

2. endMeeting ends a meeting only if the meeting is STARTED
and the current time >= end_time.
